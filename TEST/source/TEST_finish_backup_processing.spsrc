! Author : Original by Daniel James Swain
! Company: Touch Technologies, Inc
! Date   : November 16, 2007
! Purpose: The TEST_critical has kicked of the backup.bat file to
!          do the nightly backup of sf.  That process has created
!          (hopefully) some *.results files.
!          So, this process will open the .results files and scan it.
!          I am looking for two things:
!            1. Did tonights backup get there
!            2. any backup files more than 7 days old
!
!          Email the success or failure of the backups to Dan E.
!          delete any old backup zip files
!
